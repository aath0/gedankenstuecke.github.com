Born in 1985 in Muenster, Germany. Did a Bachelor's degree in life sciences there. Then moved to Frankfurt to do a Master's degree in Ecology & Evolution. Somehow developed a taste for bioinformatics/computational biology along the way. Thus now working on a PhD in Applied Bioinformatics.

Interested in Personal and Fungal Genomics, Evolutionary \(Game\) Theory, Molecular Evolution, *Do It Yourself Biology* and whatnot. During my day job I'm trying to find out how symbiotic relationships influence genomic evolution. At night I'm trying to make science more open.

Avid fan of Open \(Source\|Access\|Science\|Culture\). Convinced that basically everything is better if you add *open* in front of it. Traveling a lot and liking it. Speaks Python, R & Ruby (on Rails) and even a bit of Perl. Founder of [openSNP](https://opensnp.org).
