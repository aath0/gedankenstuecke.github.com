It's great to see that not only the *Open Access* movement is gaining momentum. The traditional publishing system – which still hasn't adapted to the digital age in many aspects – gets its fair share of critique recently. Over 7000 researchers have signed the [Cost of Knowledge](http://thecostofknowledge.com/) petition and by this pledged to refrain from publishing, refereeing or doing editorial work for *Elsevier*. The protest was partially started because of *Elsevier*s support for the *Research Works Act* but there are many things one criticize about the way *Elsevier* does business.

The [open letter published by @FakeElsevier](http://fakeelsevier.wordpress.com/2012/02/19/dear-elsevier-employees-with-love-from-fakeelsevier) gives you a nice summary of all the questionable things done over the years. You should go on and read the comments as well. One of my favorite ones is *{" «But still, you know, credit where credit’s due. Elsevier doesn’t kill babies. Directly. Any longer.» "}* but at least one participant in the comments is allegedly an employee of *Elsevier* him/herself.

If you are interested on how the current process of scientific publishing works – and why scientists still submit their work to closed access journals – you should watch this video [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=7_UAGireJpQ).
